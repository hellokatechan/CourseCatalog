## Project Overview 
A webscraping project where I was asked to scrape all the courses from [Northeastern Course Catalog](http://catalog.northeastern.edu/). The goal of this project that is so that program managers query the dataframe and see which courses are required courses, electives courses, required elective courses, and others. 

## Roadmap to Webscraping
